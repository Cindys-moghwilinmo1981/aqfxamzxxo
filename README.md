OMG, just walked outta “Death of a Unicorn” and my brain's like mashed potatoes right now. First off, why, oh WHY was the theater so loud—the popcorn crunch was the demonic soundtrack of my life. And my back? Seriously questioning my life decisions sitting on those chairs.

So anyway, the movie, right? Total headspin. There’s this scene where the unicorn (but was it even a unicorn? metaphor maybe?) dives off a cliff, and I felt like I was back in that one dream where my cat turned into a jellybean and floated away. Seriously, such trippy visuals. Rebecca’s monologue about time (who names a character Rebecca in a movie like this?!) was simultaneously nonsensical and like a fortune cookie wrapped in a riddle.

> And then the red haze. Wasn't it supposed to be symbolic? Maybe it was just the projector malfunctioning, but it felt like being trapped in a lava lamp. Whoa, need to unwind. I swear I’m still hearing the echo of that distorted violin or was it a cello? What even was the plot again? Wait, did anybody ask if we can download the movie or watch the movie online? Such a mind-bubble.

Okay, and how could anyone forget that ridiculous twist with the hamster? Like inserting a disco ball into a medieval battle scene, flashy and pointless but somehow fitting perfectly because why not?

The credits rolled and I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to clap—or sob. Sorry if I text-jibberish all this, the experience is like trying to explain algebraic decoupling to a toddler, huh. Just gotta sit and breathe this out, feel the Earth turn or something until the chaos quiets down.
